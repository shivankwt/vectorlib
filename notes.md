#### a minimal vector library in .c


what's vector: basically vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction

for now i'll implement 2D vector and operations, maybe in future i'll think about adding 
3D too.. but for now let's stick to 2D only

p.s. i am a retard when it comes to .c so if you find any errors please raise issue
